The measurement data files are as follows, along with the number of measurements:
You can adjust the training and testing sample sizes based on these numbers.

1) Out_mes_24_Tx_Rx_Mob_1: 746
2) Out_mes_24_Tx_Rx_Mob_2: 821
3) Out_mes_24_Tx_Rx_Mob_3: 801
4) Out_mes_24_Tx_Rx_Mob_4: 668
5) Out_mes_24_Tx_Rx_Mob_5: 884
   
The training and testing data generation files are as follows:
1) SCMA codebook with OR = 150%: Main_150
2) SCMA codebook with OR = 300%: Main_300
   
The proposed EDA-Net architectures are as follows:
1) SCMA codebook with OR = 150%: DNN_150
2) SCMA codebook with OR = 300%: DNN_300
   
Comparison with the ResNet model is as follows:
